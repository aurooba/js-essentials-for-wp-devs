# JS Essentials for WordPress Devs

This repository contains many of the code samples for the free "JS Essentials for WordPress Devs" course. Learn more about the course and sign up at [https://aurooba.com/js-essentials-for-wp-devs/](https://aurooba.com/js-essentials-for-wp-devs/).

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. The code is compiled using Vite, and you can run the development server using `npm run dev`.

There is a script for each lesson, and you have to enable it in the `index.html` file to see the output. It's a very basic project setup meant to aid the course and video lessons and _not meant to be a teaching tool on its own_.

But it's here in case you want to see the code in action or play around with it.
